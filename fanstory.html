									<hr><h3>My Dream Come True</h3>
									<p><strong>-Mitali Parulekar (Mumbai)</strong></p>
									<p>THIS POST MAY BE TOO LONG BUT I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT ALL MY LIFE ,SO, BEAR WITH ME! PLEASE.</p>
									<p>On 21st November,2016 the best thing of my life happened to me. Thanks to Raksha Rajesh I got a chance to see Shahrukh Khan at a shoot and that was all to it until things just started falling into place and I landed up in Shahrukh's Vanity van. </p>
									<p>The plan was simple. We had to watch him create magic on set and leave but destiny had a much better plan for me.When I saw this man in all his charm and chivalry, I was too stunned and dumbfounded to an extent where I thought that it was unreal and I was merely hallucinating. It was only when I realized that I am actually standing beside the only man I have ever loved and it was not at all a dream , that I broke down into tears. Not because of anything else but the sheer aura that he extended was so overwhelming that I knew at once that he is indeed the stuff dreams are made up of. My only reaction when he came near me was that of gentleness. All I knew was that I can't hurt him. I didn't want to do anything that would harm him may it be mobbing for a hug or screaming out his name. I just wanted to stand there and look at him from a distance and capture it all in my heart where it will eventually reside forever. But I got my hugs and blessings from him and it all fell into place because maybe the wait was worth it. It was not flashy but very pure.</p>
									<p>The people I met on set were very good and somehow with all the efforts from their side I landed up in front of my idol and the way he behaved and the way he treated me in that short interaction and the way he just understood what I was feeling at the moment without me putting it in words touched my heart.</p>
									<p>He reassured me that I have been loving and idolizing the right man all my life because this day is forever etched in my memory and I will always know that he is not a man who deserves love just for a movie called DDLJ but he deserves the love he gets for being the person that he is.</p>
									<p>Shahrukh,You are such a beautiful human being. So divine, so magical. What a man! #Srkfanforever</p><hr>
